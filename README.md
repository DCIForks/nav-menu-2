# nav-menu-2

In a [previous exercise](https://github.com/FunForks/nav-menu), you worked with the menu for [an article on the `bash alias` command](https://dciforks.github.io/nav-menu/). In that version, the menu remains on the screen at all times, and the `<main>` element has `padding-left` set wide enough for the text not to be hidden behind the menu.

In this version, there is no padding for the `<main>` section. Instead of taking up valuable screen space all the time, you can make the menu slide off-screen to the left when it is not needed.

See the expected result [here](https://funforks.github.io/nav-menu-2/)

1. Set the menu to be almost offscreen to the left (leave 0.5rem visible)
2. Edit the `nav:hover {}` rule so that the menu pops out when the mouse is over it
3. Check that when you move your mouse over the narrow strip of menu on the left, the entire menu appears.
4. Bonus: use [`transition: left 0.5s`](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp) to make the menu slide in and out slowly.

Oh, and perhaps you might like to read the article :slightly-smiling-face:
