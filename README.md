# nav-menu-2

In this version, there is no padding for the `<main>` section. Instead of taking up valuable screen space all the time, you can make the menu slide off-screen to the left when it is not needed.

1. Set the menu to be almost offscreen to the left (leave 0.5rem visible)
2. Edit the `nav:hover {}` rule so that the menu pops out when the mouse is over it
3. Bonus: use [`transition: left 0.5s`](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp) to make the menu slide out slowly
